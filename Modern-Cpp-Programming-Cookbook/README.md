# Modern C++ Programming Cookbook
This is the code repository for [Modern C++ Programming Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/modern-c-programming-cookbook?utm_source=Modern%20C%2B%2B%20Programming%20Cookbook&utm_medium=GitHub&utm_campaign=repository), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Beginning with the modern language features, each recipe addresses a specific problem, with a discussion that explains the solution and offers insight into how it works. You will learn major concepts about the core programming language as well as common tasks faced while building a wide variety of software from enterprise grade apps to low latency software. You will learn about concepts such as concurrency, performance, testing, and more in the form of recipes. These recipes will ensure you can make your applications secure and fast.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
    #include <iostream>

    int main()
    {
      std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
      return 0;
    }
```

The code presented in the book is available for download from your account at https://www.packtpub.com/, although I encourage you to try writing all the samples by yourself. In order to compile them, you need VC++ 2017 on Windows and GCC 7.0 or Clang 5.0 on Linux and Mac. If you don't have the latest version of the compiler, or you want to try another compiler, you can use one that is available online. Although there are various online platforms that you could use, I recommend https://wandbox.org/ for GCC and Clang and http://webcompiler.cloudapp.net/ for VC++.
